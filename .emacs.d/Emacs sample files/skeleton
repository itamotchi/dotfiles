If you haven't seen it yet, check out the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra
trailer at
http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/lost_skeleton/). The
dialog is beyond ridiculous and so is the acting. Well worth a
rental for Plan 9 and Ed Wood fans.  

The trailer doesn't do this flick justice, IMHO, though it gives a sense
that you're not going to have to think too hard while laughing your
way through this independent film farce.

I'm with the critics on this one; thought it was horrible, way over
the top. Atmospherium!?!
