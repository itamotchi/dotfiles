 "What name did you say?"

 "Jean Valjean.  He is a convict I saw twenty years ago when I was
assistant keeper at the Toulon galleys. On leaving the galleys, this
Valjaean, as it appears, robbed a bishop, and then committed a highway
robbery on a little Savoyard.  For eight years he has been out of the
way and could not be found, and I imagined--in a word--I did as I
said.  Passion decided me, and I denounced you to the Prefect."

 Mr. Madeleine, who had taken up the charge book again, said, with a
careless accent:

 "And what was the answer you received?"

 "That I was mad!"

 "Well?"

 "They were right."
