But clear-headed Telemakhos replied:

"Antinnoos, can I banish against her will
the mother who bore me and took care of me?
My father is either dead or far away,
but dearly I should pay for this
at Ikarios' hands, if ever I sent her back.
The pwers of darkness wuld requite it, too,
my mother's parting crse wuld call hel's fries
to punish me, along with the scorn of men. 
No: I can nver giv the wrd for this.
