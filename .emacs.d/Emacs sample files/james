My second correspondent, also a woman, sends me the following
statement:

	Life seemed difficult for me at one time. I was always
	breaking down, and had several attacks of what is called
	nervous prostration, with terrible insomnia.

Here is another case, more concrete, also that of a woman. I read you
these cases without comment--they express so many varieties of the
state of mind we are studying.
